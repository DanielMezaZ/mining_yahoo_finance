Web scrapping Yahoo Finance to build a local "database" of S&amp;P 500

Clone, make sure you have the libraries, replace the files in the main directory with those from the template subdir, execute the Python script. 

It should work just like that. The main.csv file contains the stocks that will be searched for in Yahoo Finance. If not found, only zeroes will be displayed. Historical data of the past 100 days for open,close,high,low and volume will be stored
